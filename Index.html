    <h3>Work Experience</h3>
    <H4>Amazon.co.uk - Team Lead <em>2009-2015</em></H4>
    <p>Roles</p>

        <p>While working at Amazon Swansea I filled a number of different positions as I progressed within the company. Most notable were:</p>
        
        <p>Shipping Clerk: After starting out as a temporary worker I was shortly taken on permanently and promoted to the ship Clerk position. In this role I was responsible for ensuring Trailers were loaded and departed promptly whilst adhering closely to strict health and safety rules and managing this throughout the dock team.</p>
        
        <p>Problem Solver: I was then  moved to a problem solver position where I was responsible for dealing with any issues that may arise withing the Inbound operation. I was also responsible for training new starters and problem solvers. During this time I was sent to the Doncaster Fulfilment Centre to train and improve efficiency of problem solvers and develop a guide for new problem solvers to follow.</p>
        
        <p>Team Lead: I eventually moved into a Team leader position within the Inbound stow team where during peak I was responsible for running a team of nearly 60 associates. This included dealing with shift Rotas, designating tasks/roles daily, attending operational meetings and taking daily team brief.  Ensuring Health and Safety guidelines were adhered to within the department. There were various KPIs to monitor and maintain, any issues meeting these were to be identified and actioned.</p></p>
<h4>Amazon Logistics - Operations Supervisor <em>2015-2017</em></h4>
<p>During my time as an Operations Supervisor for Amazon Logistics my time here was split between night shift and day shift which involved two very different operations.</p>

   <p>Night Shift: On night shift my team ran the sortation operation from start to end. We received our deliveries from various fulfilment centres to be sorted for onward movement to delivery centres to be sent out to the customer. From Receiving deliveries, sorting pallets and loading/departing trailers for onward delivery. This was heavily dependant on hitting times to ensure the goods met customer delivery promise.</p>
    
<p>Day Shift: We worked with various Delivery service providers to ensure goods were departed and delivered to customers on time. This involved monitoring delivery drivers, chasing DSPs promptly with any issues, sending support to struggling drivers to ensure no failed deliveries. I dealt with customer complaints and would review these and provide feedback to DSPs to improve customer experience.</p>
<h4>Owens Group - Traffic Planner <em>2017 - Present</em></h4>
<p>During my time with Owens group I have worked in both Customer service and Planning roles across across a number of depots.</p>
<p>Starting in a role providing customer service to a key customer I was responsible for Tracking collections/deliveries to ensure OTA and raise any issues promptly to ensure action could be taken to avoid customer impact. Responding in a timely manner to any customer concerns and working to resolve any issues. Building relationships with the customers team to help enhance the companies reputation with the customer. Working to KPIs and regular reporting to monitor performance and improve on future service were also important.</p>
<p>As a planner I have covered a number of different desks and depots. Dealing with a large variety of customers with different requirements and expectations. This meant learning different portals, requirements and developing contacts to help resolve issues.
    As well as dealing with different workforces whilst maintaining efficient service levels and productivity.
    Monitoring revenue per truck whilst planning to ensure that journeys were not only on time but also cost effective.
    Managing staffing levels and workload to ensure that all drivers shifts are full with no dead mileage or wasted journeys. Also that they are planned as efficiently as possible whilst liaising with other depots to avoid use of agency or extra shifts where they are not needed.
    Working with Fleet to manage servicing and MOT expectations for trailer and vehicles, ensuring they are taken in when required and no bookings are missed.
    Working with Drivers and Compliance to ensure drivers stay within WTD.</p>
    <p>During my time in this role I have also been a part of a a number of different projects to help improve operations, such as.</p>
    <p>Tablet rollout for drivers - Tablets were brought in to help make information more available to drivers as well as aiding the office staff and helping with certain customers requirements. I was heavily involved in helping get these prepared and rolled out as well as having a prominent roll in training drivers, planners and managers in the uses of them.</p>
    <p>Planning sheets - I was tasked with improving the planning sheets that were in use by the planners. Making them more visible to everyone as well as tying sheets together and uniforming the way depots planned. Keeping the Rotas tied to the planning sheet to keep better track of drivers shifts or time off. This made the information easier for planners to see, as well as anyone looking at the plan from the outside to decipher. It also helped with keeping track of revenue by each depot and provided a cleaner way of tracking and averaging this revenue.
        The rotas were then combined to enable the wages department to better keep track of drivers shifts, saving them time when dealing with queries.</p>
